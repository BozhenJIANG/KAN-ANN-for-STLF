# KAN-NN-for-STLF

## Overview

This documentation provides details on the implementation of "A Hybrid Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Artificial Neural Network based Model for Interpretable and Enhanced Short-term Load Forecasting". The model is based on a paper published on TechRxiv and can be found by searching for the corresponding article.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used for this implementation can be found at [https://github.com/dafrie/lstm-load-forecasting](https://github.com/dafrie/lstm-load-forecasting). This repository contains electricity load forecasting data for Switzerland, along with related weather and calendar information.

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment for running the KAN-NN-for-STLF model, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Conda environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n kan python=3.9.19
   conda activate kan
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pykan==0.0.5 matplotlib==3.6.2 numpy==1.24.4 scikit_learn==1.1.3 setuptools==65.5.0 torch==2.2.2 tqdm==4.66.2 xgboost==2.1.1
   ```

   **Note**: Since the dataset and its processing code originate from the `lstm-load-forecasting` repository, you may also need to install:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas==2.2.2 beautifulsoup4==4.12.3
   ```

   **Note**: The version numbers listed are provided as an example; check for the latest stable versions or compatibility with your system.

3. **Using Virtual Environments in Jupyter Notebook and Python**ï¼š
   Please see this website to use the "kan" vitual environment in Jupyter Notebook: https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/

## Usage

### Running the Model

To run the model, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Use the Jupyter Notebook to open the file `"NN+KAN-SPRING.ipynb"`.

2. **Execute the code**:
   Execute the code line by line to run the model and generate the forecast results.

Note:
> The spring case is currently annotated in English, whereas the some annotations for the remaining three seasons are in Chinese. However, all annotations will be updated to English in due course.

### Attention

- **Reproducing Results**: If you aim to reproduce the results reported in the paper, please ensure not to change any parameters in the model configuration.
- **Exploration and Improvement**: If you wish to explore and potentially improve the model's accuracy, feel free to modify the parameters and experiment with different settings.
